# Dance_dataset
a python data preprocess code of the skeleton dataset of "Letâ€™s Dance: Learning From Online Dance Videos"
https://www.cc.gatech.edu/cpl/projects/dance/

And I normalize the skeleton to (-1,1) according to the img size.

For the dataset is noisy and one frame may have many people at the same time, I also prepross the dataset so that each frame

to run the code you need to download:
